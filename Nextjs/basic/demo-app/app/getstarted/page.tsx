    <h1 className="text-4xl">Lets get started with lorem ipsum!</h1>
    <p >Lorem Ipsum serves several important functions, especially when it comes to design mockups and prototyping. Here are a few reasons why it’s so widely used in the industry:

      Focus on Visual Elements: By using placeholder text, designers and developers can focus on the overall design of the layout without worrying about the specific content. This allows them to evaluate typography, font sizes, spacing, and text alignment before filling in real content.
      Consistency: Because Lorem Ipsum mimics the structure of normal text, it provides a consistent placeholder for various content elements like paragraphs, headings, and bullet points. This consistency helps designers visualize how the final content will fit into the design.
      Avoid Distractions: Using meaningful content as a placeholder can be distracting. For example, reading actual text while working on a design may cause designers to focus on the content itself rather than the layout. Lorem Ipsum solves this by providing neutral text that doesn’t interfere with the design process.
